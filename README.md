## What is LOST
Ok, if you are here and try to know what is LOST then you probably know me, am I right.
So, see what lost is, but before that you must need to know these terms:
- *Knowledge:* Any information that help you to do something or make you happy.
- *Word:* Any work done by you that uses *knowledge* or make you happy.
- *Beauty:* Anything that help in doing the work easyly and confortable or make you happy.
- *__Happiness__:* `Happiness = (Knowlege+Work)*Beauty`

Now you are able to understand what I mean by LOST. But before that you shall know that this project will not be open-source. Now see, Lost is also `(Knowlege+Work)*Beauty`, means it is like happiness. Anyways, Lost is a 3d open-world progration-based mysterious game.
I am currently working on it. The game is based on a special theory that only I know.

>  The only drawback in this is that it is only for ___desktop___.

Mathemetically:
```
LOST ≈ Happiness ≈ (Work+Knowledge)*Beauty
```
